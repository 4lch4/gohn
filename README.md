# Gohn

This repository is home to a Go client for the [Hacker News API][0].

## Name

The name of this project is a portmanteau of "Go" and "Hacker News" and is pronounced like "Gone" or "John."

## TODO

This file is where I keep track of what needs to be done for the library to be ready for a 1.0.0 release and be considered "feature complete."

- [ ] Export objects/structs for all API responses and objects.
- [ ] Provide methods for all top-level API endpoints.
- [ ] Provide helper methods to extend the functionality of the API.
- [ ] Add tests.
  - [ ] I've never written tests for Go before so this should be fun ðŸ˜…
